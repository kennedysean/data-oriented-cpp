# Prioritizing data-oriented design paradigms in your code
This repository shows examples of data-oriented and object-oriented approaches in the design of a stock portfolio management system. **It is _not_ designed to be used for anything other than to showcase differences between software design paradigms explained in a [Medium article](https://medium.com/@kennedysean/prioritizing-data-oriented-design-paradigms-in-your-code-ddb75a79ac18) that I wrote.** Nonetheless, I hope it can be a very useful educational resource to developers.

## Running the code
If you want to see the code run for yourself, clone the repository and run ```make``` from the root directory in a Linux terminal. Assuming you have g++ and make installed, this will build the project using the directions in the [Makefile](./Makefile). Once the project is built, run ```./main``` to run the generated program that performs calculations using fake-stock-portfolio.csv. If you want to run the program on a different portfolio, you can run ```make generate-portfolio``` and ```./generate-portfolio``` to generate a new fake-stock-portfolio.csv randomly.
